Using the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor with the Arduino and Arduino IDE to monitor the soil in my plants. This smart home project will result in knowing when the plants should be watered.

Readings will be displayed to monitor moisture levels. Can be useful for different types of plants which may have different requirements.	

Combining this with measuring the temperature and humidity in the room, conditions can be kept at their optimal to support the growth of the plants.

Can be expanded to become an auomatic irrigation system for plants combining soil moisture data with room temperature and humidity.
